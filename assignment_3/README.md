# Swedish anagrams

## Program description
This programs finds anagrams for a word specified by the user. 
NB: The dictionary used in this program is in Swedish, so you will only get anagrams for Swedish words.


## How to run the program
There are two versions of the program:

For *anagram_1.py*, just run the program. Once it is running, you will be prompted to enter
a word. Once you have entered a word, the system will output anagrams of this word.

*anagram_2.py* is supposed to be run directly from the terminal (it uses sys.argv). Just pass the word you want anagrams for as an argument when calling the program.

Example: 
1. Open your computer's terminal.
2. Navigate to the folder that contains the python file (*anagram_2.py*), the bubble sort file (*bubble_sort.py*), and the dictionary file(*sv-utf8.txt*).
3. At the prompt, type in the following command (using whichever word you want anagrams for): 

\>\>\> python anagram_2.py "XXXX"
