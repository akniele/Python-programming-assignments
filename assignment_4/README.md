# Spell correction and suggested continuations

## Program description
This program mimicks the behavior of cell phones when users type
in text. The program will check if a word is spelled correctly, and if it is, give three suggestions for the
next word, whereas if the word is misspelled, it will give three suggestions for alternative spellings.

A word is considered to be spelled correctly if it can be found in the lexicon file *ukenglish.txt*. 
The words that are suggested as continuations are taken from a file 
with UN texts, *corpus.txt*.

## How to run the program
The lexicon file and the corpus file need to be in the same folder as the python file (*spell_correction.py*) for this program to run.
Once you have called the python file, you will be prompted to type in a word. After that, just follow the instructions 
on the screen.
